</header>

<h3>A Community built on connections</h3>
<p>In our present economy. It has become increasingly expensive to get temporary accomodations. Travelling to other states for job interviews, shows, carnivals and so on can dig a large hole in your pocket leaving many out of the experiences and achieving their dreams.  Now hosts and travelers can choose to create a free Bedspace account so they can list their space and book one night accommodations anywhere in Nigeria.</p>
<br>
<h3>Profiles<h3>
<p>No two hosts or travelers are the same, so personal Bedspace profiles help hosts and guests learn more about each other before sharing a space. Bedspace doesn't display full names or contact information on public profiles, so the community can feel confident that their information is safe.</p>
<br>
<h3>Security<h3>
<P>At Bedspace we verify all our users, even going to locations to ascertain the conditions of the boarding facilities toward ensure our users get the full experience of our services. For lodgers we verify via BVN and Facebook to ensure that any violations of the terms and conditions will be handled by the appropriate authorities.</p>
